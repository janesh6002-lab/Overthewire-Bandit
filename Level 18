# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 17 → Level 18


## 🎯 Level Goal
There are two files in the home directory:
`passwords.old` and `passwords.new`.

The password for the next level is located in
`passwords.new` and is the **only line that differs**
between the two files.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
Both files appear almost identical, but one line has been
modified in `passwords.new`.

By comparing the contents of the two files line by line,
the changed entry can be identified, which reveals the
password for the next level.

This level focuses on detecting **differences between files**.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Locate both password files  
- Compare their contents  
- Identify the modified line  
- Extract the new password  

---

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- File comparison techniques  
- Identifying changes between versions of files  
- Managing and reviewing sensitive data  

---

## 🛡️ Security Insight
Storing passwords in versioned or compared files can
accidentally expose credentials if differences are not
carefully controlled.
