# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 27 → Level 28


## 🎯 Level Goal
A **Git repository** is hosted remotely and must be accessed using SSH.

The repository is available at:
`ssh://bandit27-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit27-git/repo`
on **port 2220**.

The password for `bandit27-git` is the same as the password for
**bandit27**.

The task is to **clone the repository locally** and find the
password for the next level.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
This level introduces interaction with **remote Git repositories**
over **SSH**.

Once the repository is cloned to a local machine, its contents can be
examined to locate the password stored inside the project files.

This emphasizes the importance of reviewing source code and repository
contents for sensitive information.

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Use the bandit27 password for authentication  
- Clone the remote Git repository locally  
- Inspect the repository contents  
- Locate the password for the next level

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- Cloning Git repositories over SSH  
- Using SSH authentication with Git
