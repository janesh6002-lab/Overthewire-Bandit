# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 18 → Level 19

---

## 🎯 Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file named `readme`
in the **home directory**.

However, the `.bashrc` file has been modified to **automatically log
you out** when you connect using SSH.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
Normally, SSH opens an interactive shell after login.
In this level, the modified `.bashrc` forces an immediate logout,
preventing normal command execution.

To solve this, commands must be executed **non-interactively**
during the SSH connection, allowing the file to be read
before the logout occurs.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Bypass the interactive shell  
- Execute a command directly during SSH login  
- Read the `readme` file  
- Retrieve the next level password  

---

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- Difference between interactive and non-interactive shells  
- How shell startup files affect login behavior  
- Executing commands remotely via SSH  

---

## 🛡️ Security Insight
Improper shell configuration can disrupt access,
but attackers may still bypass restrictions if command
execution is allowed during login.
