# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 23 → Level 24

## 🎯 Level Goal
A program is being executed automatically at regular intervals using
**cron**, the time-based job scheduler.

To solve this level, you must analyze the cron configuration in
`/etc/cron.d/` and create your **own shell script** that is executed
by the scheduled job.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
This level introduces writing a **custom shell script**.

The cron job executes scripts placed in a specific directory with
certain permissions. When your script runs, it can access data that
is normally restricted.

The script is automatically **removed after execution**, so keeping
a backup copy is important while testing.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Inspect the cron job configuration  
- Identify where executable scripts are picked up  
- Create a custom shell script  
- Ensure correct permissions  
- Let cron execute the script and retrieve the password  

---

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- Writing basic shell scripts  
- Cron job execution flow  
- File permissions and automation  

---

## 🛡️ Security Insight
Automatically executing user-controlled scripts with elevated
privileges is dangerous and can easily lead to credential exposure.
