# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 31 → Level 32


---

## 🎯 Level Goal
A **Git repository** is hosted remotely and must be accessed using SSH.

The repository is available at:
`ssh://bandit31-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit31-git/repo`
on **port 2220**.

The password for `bandit31-git` is the same as the password for
**bandit31**.

The task is to **clone the repository locally** and find the
password for the next level.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
This level focuses on **interacting with a Git repository that enforces
specific rules**.

The repository may reject normal commits unless certain conditions
are met. By carefully reading repository instructions and understanding
Git behavior, it becomes possible to store or retrieve the required
information.

This level emphasizes attention to detail and correct Git usage.
