# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 2 → Level 3


---

## 🎯 Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called  
`--spaces in this filename--`
located in the **home directory**.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
This level introduces a filename containing **spaces**.  
Linux treats spaces as separators, so filenames with spaces must be
handled carefully using **quotes** or **escaped spaces** to be read
correctly.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Navigate to the home directory  
- Identify the file with spaces in its name  
- Read the file by properly handling the spaces
