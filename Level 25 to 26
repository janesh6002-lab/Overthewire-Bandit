# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 25 → Level 26

---

## 🎯 Level Goal
Logging in to **bandit26** from **bandit25** is possible, but the default
shell for user `bandit26` is **not `/bin/bash`**.

The task is to identify which shell is being used, understand how it
works, and find a way to **break out of it** to gain normal shell access.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
Instead of a standard shell, `bandit26` uses a **restricted or alternate
shell** designed to limit user interaction.

Such shells often allow viewing files or paging output but restrict
command execution. By understanding the behavior of this shell and
its escape mechanisms, it is possible to regain a full interactive shell.

This level highlights how shell restrictions can sometimes be bypassed.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Log in as `bandit26`  
- Identify the non-standard shell in use  
- Analyze its behavior and limitations  
- Escape the restricted shell environment  

---

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- Non-standard and restricted shells  
- Shell escape techniques  
- Importance of understanding default user environments  

---

## 🛡️ Security Insight
Restricted shells can reduce risk, but if escape methods exist,
they may still allow full access if not properly hardened.
