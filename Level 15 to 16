# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 15 → Level 16
---

## 🎯 Level Goal
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the
current level’s password to **port 30001 on localhost** using
**SSL/TLS encryption**.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
Unlike the previous level, this service requires a **secure encrypted
connection** using **SSL/TLS**.

A normal plaintext connection will not work. The password must be sent
through a **TLS-encrypted channel**, and if the password is correct,
the service responds with the password for the next level.

Messages such as **DONE**, **RENEGOTIATING**, or **KEYUPDATE** are normal
TLS handshake behavior and do not indicate failure.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Connect to a local service on **port 30001**  
- Use **SSL/TLS encryption** for the connection  
- Submit the current level password securely  
- Receive the password for the next level  

---

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- SSL/TLS encrypted communication  
- Difference between plaintext and secure connections  
- Interacting with encrypted network services  

---

## 🛡️ Security Insight
Encrypted services protect sensitive information from being intercepted,
highlighting the importance of TLS in secure network communication.
