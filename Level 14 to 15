# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 14 → Level 15



---

## 🎯 Level Goal
The password for the next level can be retrieved by **submitting the current
level’s password** to **port 30000 on localhost**.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
In this level, a **service is running locally** on the machine and is
listening on **port 30000**.

The service expects the **password of the current level** as input.
If the correct password is provided, the service responds with the
**password for the next level**.

This demonstrates how services can communicate over network ports,
even on the same machine.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Connect to a service running on **localhost**  
- Send the current level password as input  
- Receive and read the response from the service  

---

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- Basics of network communication  
- Interacting with services via open ports  
- Understanding localhost-based services  

---

## 🛡️ Security Insight
Services listening on open ports can leak sensitive information if
they do not properly validate or restrict access.
