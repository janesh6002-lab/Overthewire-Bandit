# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 12 → Level 13


---

## 🎯 Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file `data.txt`,
which is a **hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed**.

For this level, it may be useful to create a working directory under
`/tmp` to safely extract and process the file contents.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
This level involves **multiple layers of encoding and compression**.
The file must first be converted back from a hexdump into its original
binary form.  
After that, the file needs to be **identified and decompressed repeatedly**
until the final readable password file is revealed.

Using a temporary working directory helps avoid clutter and accidental
file overwrites.

- Create a temporary working directory  
- Copy the `data.txt` file into it  
- Convert the hexdump back to binary  
- Repeatedly identify and decompress the file  
- Read the final file to obtain the password
