# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 20 → Level 21

---

## 🎯 Level Goal
A **setuid binary** in the home directory connects to **localhost**
on a port specified as a command-line argument.

It reads a line of input from the connection and compares it with
the **previous level’s password (bandit20)**.
If the password is correct, it sends back the
**password for bandit21**.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
This level combines **setuid binaries** with **network communication**.

The binary runs with elevated privileges and connects to a local
network service. It expects the **current level password** to be
sent through that connection.

To solve this level, a local service must be created that sends the
correct password to the binary when it connects.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Identify the behavior of the setuid binary  
- Set up a local network listener  
- Provide the correct password to the binary  
- Receive the password for the next level  

---

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- Interaction between setuid binaries and network services  
- Localhost port communication  
- Secure password verification mechanisms  

---

## 🛡️ Security Insight
Setuid programs that rely on network input can be risky if inputs
are not properly validated, potentially leading to privilege misuse.
