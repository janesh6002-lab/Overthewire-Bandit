# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 13 → Level 14


---

## 🎯 Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in  
`/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` and can only be read by **user bandit14**.

For this level, you do **not** get the password directly.  
Instead, you are provided with a **private SSH key** that must be used
to log into the next level.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
Normal password-based login is not possible for this level.
Instead, authentication is done using **SSH key-based login**.

The private key acts as a secure credential that allows access to the
`bandit14` account. Proper file permissions are required for the key,
otherwise SSH will refuse to use it.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Locate the provided private SSH key  
- Ensure the key has correct permissions  
- Use the key to log in as `bandit14` via SSH  
- Access the restricted password file as the correct user
