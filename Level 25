# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 24 → Level 25


---

## 🎯 Level Goal
A daemon is listening on **port 30002** and will provide the password
for **bandit25** if given:
- The correct **bandit24 password**
- A **secret 4-digit numeric pincode**

The pincode cannot be retrieved directly and must be found by
trying **all possible combinations (0000–9999)**.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
This level introduces the concept of **brute-force attacks**.

The service validates both the password and a 4-digit PIN.
Since there is no hint or shortcut for the PIN, every possible
combination must be tested.

The service allows reuse of the **same connection**, making it
efficient to automate the attempts instead of reconnecting
for each guess.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Connect to the service on **port 30002**  
- Submit the current level password  
- Systematically try all 4-digit PIN combinations  
- Identify the correct PIN  
- Receive the password for the next level  

---

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- Brute-force techniques  
- Automating repetitive authentication attempts  
- Efficient interaction with network services  

---

## 🛡️ Security Insight
Weak numeric PINs are highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks,
especially when no rate-limiting or lockout mechanisms are enforced.
