# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 29 → Level 30

---

## 🎯 Level Goal
A **Git repository** is hosted remotely and must be accessed using SSH.

The repository is available at:
`ssh://bandit29-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit29-git/repo`
on **port 2220**.

The password for `bandit29-git` is the same as the password for
**bandit29**.

The task is to **clone the repository locally** and find the
password for the next level.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
This level emphasizes exploring **different branches** in a Git
repository.

The password is not present in the default branch but exists in
another branch. By listing and switching between branches, hidden
information can be uncovered.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Authenticate using the bandit29 password  
- Clone the remote Git repository locally  
- List and explore available branches  
- Locate the password for the next level  

---

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- Understanding Git branches  
- Navigating between branches  
- Discovering hidden data in version control  

---

## 🛡️ Security Insight
Sensitive information stored in non-default branches can still be
accessed and should be treated with the same security care.
