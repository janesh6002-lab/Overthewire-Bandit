# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 19 → Level 20


---

## 🎯 Level Goal
To gain access to the next level, a **setuid binary** located in the
home directory must be used.

After correctly using the binary, the password for the next level
can be found in the usual location:
`/etc/bandit_pass/bandit20`.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
A **setuid binary** runs with the permissions of its owner instead of
the user who executes it.

In this level, the binary is owned by the next user. When executed
correctly, it temporarily grants higher privileges, allowing access
to files that are normally restricted.

Running the binary **without arguments** provides guidance on how it
should be used.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Locate the setuid binary in the home directory  
- Execute it to understand its usage  
- Use it correctly to gain elevated privileges  
- Read the restricted password file  

---

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- Understanding setuid permissions  
- Privilege escalation via binaries  
- Controlled access to protected files  

---

## 🛡️ Security Insight
Improperly configured setuid binaries can be dangerous, as they may
allow users to gain unintended elevated access.
