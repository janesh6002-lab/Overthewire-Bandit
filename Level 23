# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 22 → Level 23

## 🎯 Level Goal
A program is being executed automatically at regular intervals using
**cron**, the time-based job scheduler.

The task is to inspect the configuration files in
`/etc/cron.d/` and determine **which command is being run**.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
This level focuses on understanding **cron job scripts**.

The cron configuration points to a shell script that is intentionally
written to be easy to read. By carefully reviewing the script logic,
it is possible to determine where and how the password for the next
level is handled.

If the script behavior is unclear, executing it can reveal helpful
debug information that explains its operation.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Examine cron job configurations  
- Locate the referenced shell script  
- Analyze the script’s logic  
- Identify how the next level’s password is generated or stored  

---

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- Reading and understanding shell scripts  
- Debugging script behavior  
- Cron-based automation analysis  

---

## 🛡️ Security Insight
Readable but insecure scripts executed by cron can expose sensitive
data if access controls are not properly enforced.
