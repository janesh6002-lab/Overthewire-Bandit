# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 30 → Level 31


---

## 🎯 Level Goal
A **Git repository** is hosted remotely and must be accessed using SSH.

The repository is available at:
`ssh://bandit30-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit30-git/repo`
on **port 2220**.

The password for `bandit30-git` is the same as the password for
**bandit30**.

The task is to **clone the repository locally** and find the
password for the next level.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
In this level, the password is **not stored in regular files** within
the repository.

Instead, the information is hidden inside **Git metadata**, such as
tags or commit references. Exploring these Git objects reveals the
password for the next level.

This level highlights how Git can store meaningful data outside of
the working directory.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Authenticate using the bandit30 password  
- Clone the remote Git repository locally  
- Inspect Git metadata (such as tags)  
- Retrieve the password for the next level  

---

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- Git tags and metadata  
- Inspecting non-file Git objects  
- Advanced Git repository exploration  

---

## 🛡️ Security Insight
Sensitive data stored in Git metadata can be easily overlooked,
yet remains accessible to anyone with repository access.
