## 🎯 Level Goal
A program is being executed automatically at regular intervals using
**cron**, the time-based job scheduler.

The task is to inspect the configuration files in
`/etc/cron.d/` and determine **which command is being run**.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
Cron is used in Linux systems to schedule tasks that run automatically
in the background.

Configuration files inside `/etc/cron.d/` define jobs that are executed
at specific times or intervals, often with elevated privileges.

By reviewing these files, it is possible to identify scripts or commands
that handle sensitive data, such as passwords for the next level.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Explore the cron configuration directory  
- Identify scheduled jobs  
- Analyze the command being executed  
- Locate how the next level’s password is handled  

---

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- Understanding cron and scheduled tasks  
- Reading system-wide cron configurations  
- Identifying automated privilege-based executions  

---

## 🛡️ Security Insight
Misconfigured cron jobs can unintentionally expose sensitive
information or allow privilege escalation if not properly secured.
