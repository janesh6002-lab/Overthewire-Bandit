# 🕹️ OverTheWire Bandit – Level 16 → Level 17

---

## 🎯 Level Goal
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the
current level’s password to a service running on **localhost** within
the port range **31000–32000**.

---

## 🔍 Explanation
Multiple services are running on different ports in the given range.
Some accept **plaintext connections**, while others use **SSL/TLS**.

Most services simply echo back whatever input they receive.
Only **one service** is configured to return the **next level’s
credentials** when the correct password is submitted over the
appropriate connection type.

Identifying the correct **listening port** and **encryption method**
is the key challenge of this level.

---

## 🧪 Solution Summary
- Identify active services in the given port range  
- Distinguish between plaintext and SSL/TLS services  
- Submit the current level password correctly  
- Retrieve the next level credentials  

---

## 🔐 Concept Learned
- Port scanning and service discovery  
- Differentiating encrypted vs unencrypted services  
- Secure credential exchange over networks  

---

## 🛡️ Security Insight
Exposing multiple services without proper restrictions increases
attack surface and can unintentionally leak sensitive credentials.
